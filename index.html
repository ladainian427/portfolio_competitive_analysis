	   <p>Classy - Nothing childish, sticks with simple fonts and colors, nothing flashy</p>
	   <p>Stylish - Simple content but still able to portray a sense of class and style. Reminds me of something you'd see in New York.</p>

      <td>Interaction</td>
      <td>Search bar, mouse over, horizontal side scroll for transitions. Also uses coverflow to display the different samples.</td>

      <td>Has subtabs to show you which tab you're on. Easy to learn, hard to get lost. Organized by recent projects, blogs, and clients.</td>
